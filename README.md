#CitiBikes
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data about the use of Citibikes in NYC to help make future decisions about Citibike usage. We needed to gather as much data as we could. So that we could show detail visual to the investors. In the hopes to convince them that a bike-sharing program would be a great program for Des Moines. 

## Results
You will see a link below to the story we created in Tableau. It contains visualizations we made when reviewing the data. Each visualization has a description with it. https://public.tableau.com/profile/alainacox#!/vizhome/BikeCitiChallenge/NYCCitiBike

## Summary
One thing you will notice is that males are far more likely to checkout citibikes. Another thing you will see is that the bike checkouts are higher during the week than on the weekend. When deciding whether to take citibike to Des Moines, this data could be used as a starting point to decide if Des Moines has the demographics for this. It can also help on who to market to. What kind of promotions to offer to get more females interested.
